# Foto-website

Developed a personal photography website for a small business. <br/>
The site features a clean and simple design with a dynamic homepage, including smooth transitions, an interactive feedback carousel, and a social media footer alongside administrative pages such as terms and conditions, cookies, and confidentiality policy. <br/>
The menu includes an offer and a portfolio page with multiple photo-cards – the first leading to different photo packages and the subsequent one leading to galleries from each category. <br/>
The last main page is the contact page, which presents a contact form connected to the client's email via PHP Mailer service and provides details on how the client can be reached through various methods. <br/>
